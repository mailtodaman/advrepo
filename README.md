# advrepo
The Advance Repository is a really advanced tool to help setup your environment.The Code is written in Django, Python, JavaScript and Handsontable.
On the web interface you can find the excel sheet, where you can write sequence of steps in the each row. You can write the code in any scripting language and execute it in command or any terminal.

Our Motivation behind the project: There are hunderds of different sources of information available such as http, svn, git, perforce, ftp, wget,curl, and so on. Our Idea is to consolidate all the steps to get the information in one place and the developer should just run one command to populate data from many places. You can also maintain the history, make branch of each setup, create tags, etc.

We are also looking for sponsor to support this project.

Example: advrepo http://<your_server:<port>>/Project/trunk/<ID>
  
  Our goal with advrepo is to make life easier for developer!
